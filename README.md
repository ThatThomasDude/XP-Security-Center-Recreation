A recreation of Windows XP's Security Center

Here's what doesn't work currently:

1. "What's new in Windows to help protect my computer?" link
2. The section between "Firewall, Automatic Updates, Virus Protection" is for looks only.
3. When you resize a window, items don't follow along.
4. Users who use CPL redirection may get the error saying: "Can not find script file 'redir.vbs'"
