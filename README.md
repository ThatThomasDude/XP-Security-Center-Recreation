A recreation of Windows XP's Security Center

Here's what doesn't work currently:

1. "Recommendations" button
2. "What's new in Windows to help protect my computer?" link
3. "Change the way Security Center alerts me" link
4. The section between "Firewall, Automatic Updates, Virus Protection" is for looks only.
5. When you resize a window, items don't follow along.
